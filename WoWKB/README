!! BACK UP YOUR SavedVariables/WoWKB.lua !!

Enhancements were made to the import/merge code - you may want to re-import
your MetaMap or old WoWKB data as it may pick up additional data (no duplicates
will be created)

Description
*******************************************************************************

This AddOn stores the name, description, level, rarity and location of all the
NPCs/mobs you mouse over. The location is stored as a range to allow for
movement or various spawn points. The range is updated every time you find the
NPC in a different location. The WoWKB database is global - all your characters
on the same computer and account can access it.


*******************************************************************************
Philosophy
*******************************************************************************

This section is about what WoWKB is and what it is not. The first thing to
know is that it is not possible to precisely determine the location of an NPC
or mob in WoW. Early on they decided to disable the ability to get the
location of anything but yourself to disable range-checking AddOns.

As a result WoWKB doesn't actually keep track of NPC/mob locations - it keeps
track of the position at which you were standing when you moused-over a given
NPC/mob. For the most part, this works fine. The imporant thing to realize
though is that the locations are not going to be exact.  In some cases, they
will be pretty far off all depending on how far away from a particular
NPC/mob you can be and mouse-over it.

To better visualize where things can be found I've implemented MapNotes and
Cartographer support which I strongly recommend you take advantage of. There's
an option in MapNotes (enabled by default) which will create a bounding box
with a center point on the map when you left-click an NPC/mob in the results
window. Cartographer supports only the center point as, at the time of this
writing, it has no way to draw lines on the map.  This could get cluttered
pretty fast but the way I've intended WoWKB and MapNotes/Cartographer to be
used together makes notes you create on the map, or at least those created by
WoWKB, a very temporary thing. You create notes when you need them (i.e.
hunting a particular mob or looking for a particular NPC) and then when things
start to get cluttered you can remove the notes for a particular NPC/mob by
right-clicking it in the results window or remove all the WoWKB notes by
clicking the Clear Map Notes button.

Of course, I'm open to new ideas on how to best present the data that WoWKB
is able to gather so if you've got any ideas, let me know.


*******************************************************************************
Features
*******************************************************************************

[Slash Commands]

You can use the following commands to perform a search (ommiting search term
will list all records in the database):

/wowkb [search term]
or
/wkb [search term]


[User Interface]

The coordinates in the results are color-coded based on your location:
Green - Within the min/max range the NPC/mob was seen
Yellow - In the same zone as the NPC/mob
Red - In a different zone than the NPC/mob

There are two different formats for the coordinates listed after the name and
description of the NPC/mob.

(XX.XX, YY.YY) - This form means the range is less than three map units which
generally means the NPC/mob stays in the same spot or you
haven't seen it very many times. The X and Y coordinates are
expressed to the nearest 1/100th of a map unit.

(xx-XX), (yy-YY) - This form means the range is greater than or equal to three
map units and expresses the X and Y coordinates as a range
from min x to max X and min y to max Y.

You can sort the results by name, description, level, rarity, zone or
coordinates by clicking on the appropriate column heading.  Clicking on the
same heading a second time will sort that column in reverse order.  Sorting by
coordinates does a sort by distance for any results which are in the same zone
(green/yellow.)

The number of NPCs/mobs found as well as the number of zones they were found
across is displayed in the information bar.  This bar will also display error
messages, etc.


[Other Features]

Remove unwanted entries from the database with <Shift>+<Ctrl>+Right-click

Insert the text from an entry into chat by opening the chat input bar and
then <Shift>+Left-clicking the entry you want to insert.

Import/Merge other WoWKB data files from friends, guildmates, etc. see the
section devoted to this topic below.


[Optional Map Notes Support*]

In the search results window:
Left-click - Add a map note (or a group of MapNotes, see the options below)
on the WorldMap and a MiniNote on the MiniMap for the entry
Right-click - Remove any map notes for the entry

From the main interface:
Clear Map Notes button - clears all the MapNotes/Cartographer Notes created by WoWKB

*Requires:
MapNotes v3.17.20000+ - http://wow.curse-gaming.com/en/files/details/4116/mapnotes-fans-update/
or
Cartographer r25291+ - http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info6403-Cartographer.html


*******************************************************************************
Options
*******************************************************************************

Show Only Local NPCs
Shows only the green and yellow entries when enabled

Show Updates
For debugging purposes, displays database changes (verbose)

Create MapNotes Bounding Box (MapNotes only)
Create four MapNotes with lines connecting them representing the NW,
NE, SW and SE bounds of the NPC/mob versus just a single MapNote marking
the center point

Add MiniNotes To MiniMap (MapNotes only)
Controls whether a MiniNote will be added to the MiniMap when MapNotes are
created by left-clicking an entry

Keep Only The Last MiniNote (MapNotes only)
Controls whether previous MiniNotes will be cleared before adding a new one
to the MiniMap (only in effect if the Add MiniNotes To MiniMap option is
enabled)


*******************************************************************************
Importing/Merging Data
*******************************************************************************

NOTE: MetaMapWKB data is automatically imported when WoWKB loads and detects
MetaMapWKB data so you need only enable both AddOns and enter the game.

NOTE: This feature is for combining multiple WoWKB data files, old versions of
      your WoWKB data will be converted to the new data format automatically
      when you log into the game with an old version.

    1. Log out of WoW

    2. BACKUP YOUR WoWKB.lua FILE!
         ./World of Warcraft/WTF/Account/USER/SavedVariables/WoWKB.lua

    3. Open the file to import in a text editor, I'll call it WoWKB2.lua

    4. Rename the WoWKB_Data table to WoWKB_ImportData

                WoWKB_Data = {
                    ...
                }

                becomes:

                WoWKB_ImportData = {
                    ...
                }

    5. Rename the WoWKB_State table to WoWKB_ImportState

    6. Rename the WoWKB_UnknownZones table to WoWKB_ImportUnknownZones

    7. Copy the entire contents of WoWKB2.lua (which contains WoWKB_ImportData,
        WoWKB_ImportState and WoWKB_ImportUnknownZones) to the end of the
        WoWKB.lua that you want to import it into.  If you made the changes to
        WoWKB2.lua above, you could accomplish this with the command:

                Windows:
                    C:\> type WoWKB2.lua >> WoWKB.lua

                OS X / Linux:
                    $ cat WoWKB2.lua >> WoWKB.lua

        So you have a file like this:

                WoWKB_Data = {
                    ...
                }

                WoWKB_State = {
                    ...
                }

                WoWKB_UnknownZones = {
                    ...
                }

                WoWKB_ImportData = {
                    ...
                }

                WoWKB_ImportState = {
                    ...
                }

                WoWKB_ImportUnknownZones = {
                    ...
                }

    8. Log in to WoW, you should see the message:

'<WoWKB>: WoWKB_ImportData merged successfully, added X entries and updated Y'
